:package_description


## Installation

Install the package with [`Composer`](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require :vendor_slug/:package_slug
```

Publish the assets they are copied to `public/vendor/:package_slug`.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-assets"
```

You can publish and run the migrations using:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You may also publish additional resources to tailor the package to your project:

- Config file to adjust defaults package settings:
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-config"
  ```

  - Check the current configurations in [here](config/:package_slug.php).

- Views (if you need to override the Blade views):
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-views"
  ```


## Usage

```php
$instance = new \VendorName\Skeleton();
echo $instance->somethingNonStatic();
// OR
\VendorName\Skeleton\Facades\Skeleton::somethingStatic();
```


## Development

- Since the package is utilizing [Orchestra Testbench](https://packages.tools) for the testing environment, its configuration file [testbench.yaml](testbench.yaml) should be looked at.
- Running the Laravel Boost MCP server is done with `./vendor/bin/testbench boost:mcp` instead of `php artisan boost:mcp` or optionally via VSC command prompts.
  - Normally, VSC users should have their MCP client pointing at `./vendor/bin/testbench boost:mcp`. (Check [.vscode/mcp.json](.vscode/mcp.json))
  - HOWEVER, I have consistent configuration in [`laravel-boost-mcp.sh`](./laravel-boost-mcp.sh) file to look for both application setup's boost as well as the package's. And that's why we're pointing to that Bash file to handle the redirection.

### Codex MCP Connection

If you're using ChatGPT Codex in VSC or whatever, make sure your `config.toml` has at least the following:

```toml
[mcp_servers.laravel-boost]
command = "./laravel-boost-mcp.sh"
```

**I was only able to get it to work using the `@openai/cli` package ran via `npm`, and the VSC extension wan't able to establish a connection for some reason... Still, the VSC extension is very useful to ask when the environment is broken and retain full access to project files.**

### Workbench Laravel Environment

Keep in mind the following when using Workbench:
  - Run `./vendor/bin/testbench` instead of `artisan` for Laravel commands; maybe you'd create also an system terminal alias for it, I use `bench`.
    - Composer `scripts` listed in [composer.json](./composer.json) utilize it for the commands.
    - After running `composer serve`, visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the demo page in action.

### Testing

```bash
composer test
```

> [!NOTE]
> For code coverage add `--coverage`, and for faster runs add `--parallel`.
